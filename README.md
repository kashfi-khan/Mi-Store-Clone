# 🛍️ Mi Store Clone – React.js + CSS

This is a front-end clone of the official Mi Store, developed using **React.js** and **plain CSS**.

## 🚀 Purpose

I built this project as a part of my self-learning journey to strengthen React fundamentals and improve component-based UI skills.  
While the concept was inspired by an online tutorial, the entire project was written from scratch by me — no copy-pasting involved.
